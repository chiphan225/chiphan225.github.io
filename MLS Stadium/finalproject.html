    <h1>Map of MLS Stadiums</h1>
    <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is the premier professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. The league has 24 teams in 24 stadiums as of the 2019 season: 21 in the United States and 3 in Canada. At the time of the league's inauguration in 1996, MLS teams used multi-purpose stadiums, often shared with National Football League (NFL) or college football teams. Because of lower attendance, these stadiums had parts tarped off to artificially reduce capacity. Starting in 1999 with the Columbus Crew's construction of Mapfre Stadium, the league has constructed soccer-specific stadiums which are tailor-made for soccer and which have smaller capacity. Today, the majority of MLS stadiums are soccer-specific stadiums. This is a map representing the 24 stadiums of Major League Soccer. The color of the circles is determined by team conference.</p>
